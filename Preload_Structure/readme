In this folder, you can add customized structures or use existing ones.

There are two ways to create a new layer structure:

One is to do it directly in the UI, which is more convenient;

Another one is to create or modify the .csv files in this folder, which is more versatile.

Everyone are more than welcome to upload useful structures to this folder.

Please put your initial at the end of the file name.
